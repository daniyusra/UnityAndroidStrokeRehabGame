# unity-android-stroke-rehab-game

On this repository, you will find an attempt on making a motion-capture video game using Unity. 
The motion capture side of things is implemented with the help of Google ML's Kit.

A lot of inspiration - especially on connecting Google ML, Android Studio, with Unity -  comes from [Unity Technologies Native Camera ](https://github.com/robsondepaula/unity-android-native-camera).
